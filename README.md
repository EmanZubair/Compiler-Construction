Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a fully functional compiler by gradually enhancing the parser component. Each commit represents a specific change, addition, or improvement to the parser code, which helps transform source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and perform syntax analysis.

Features:
Parser enhancements step by step
Syntax analysis improvements
New grammar rule additions
Compiler construction best practices
Well-documented code modifications
